about 1.5 hours. Finding my own fractal is time-consuming.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe how you came up with your own fractal (that is, by 
 *  experimentation or did you find the fractal on the web).  I don't
 *  mind if you find an interesting fractal pattern on the web or from
 * a book, so long as you tell me _and_ you don't get the code for
 * programming the fractal from the web or from a book.

I found the sierspinky carpet fractal on the web which looks interesting to me and not too complicated. The code is completely my own.

No, I have done it mainly by myself. I have asked Andrew a couple questions about syntax.
