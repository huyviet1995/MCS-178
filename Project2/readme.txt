/**********************************************************************
 *  How does the mean squared distance of a random walker grow
 *  as a function of the number of steps N?  Briefly justify your
 *  answer based on computational experiments.  (Describe the

 *********************************************************************/
The mean squared distance of a random walker approaches closer to n (The number of moves) as the number of steps taken increases. For example, let n be 20 and t be 100. The mean squared distances are 20.62, 18.46,20.06 after 3 different runs (error within 5% of n). When t is increased to 20000, the mean squared distances are 20.0557, 19.875, 20.0181. (off within 1% of n). When t is increased to 200000, the mean squared distances after 3 trials are respectively 20.07669,20.06232,20.01923 (off within 0.5% of n). This clearly shows that when the number of trials increases, the mean squared distance value is closer to n. In addition, the increase of accuracy reduces as t is increased (5%->1%->0.5%).
